        <h3>These Chile Sopaipillas are amazing and a true Chilean treasure.</h3>
        <p>They are similar to a doughnut.  In Chile they are typically made with pumpkin or squash. I just used pumpkin puree from the can and the results were delicious.</p>
        <p>These would be wonderful for breakfast too! They also make a savory version that is typically served as bread with a meal and butter or pebre is spread on the top.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups self-raising flour</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 cup cooked pumpkin </li>
            <li>¼ cup unsalted butter melted</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>1 cup brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 stick cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/2 orange cut into 8 pieces</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil for frying</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine flour and salt in a large bowl, set aside.</li>
            <li>Combine cooked pumpkin or puree and butter in a separate bowl and stir until combined.</li>
            <li>Make a well in the flour mixture, add pumpkin mixture and stir and knead until combined. Add a little water if it is too dry. When the dough cleans the bowl it is perfect.</li>
            <li>On a floured surface, roll out the dough to about ¼ inch thick, use a cookie cutter or small bowl to make rounds about 3 inches in diameter.</li>
            <li>Combine brown sugar, water cinnamon, and orange slices in a pot over medium heat and bring to a boil. Boil for about 4 minutes until slightly thickened. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat oil to 350 degrees in a wok, frying pan or deep fryer, add pastry rounds a few at a time and fry until puffed and golden, turning halfway through, about 1 to 2 minutes per side. Drain on a paper towel.</li>
            <li>Working a few at a time, add fried sopaipillas to syrup, remove and serve immediately with some extra syrup.</li>
        </ol>
