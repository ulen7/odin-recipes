        <h3>Humitas or steamed fresh corn cakes</h3>
        <p>Humitas are savory steamed fresh corn cakes made from a mixture of freshly ground corn,</p>
        <p>onion, garlic, cheese, eggs, and cream, which is placed inside corn husks and steamed.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>6-7 fresh ears of corn with husks</li>
            <li>3 cups grated or crumbled cheese</li>
            <li>1 cup diced white onions about ½ large onion</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves crushed</li>
            <li>About 1 cup corn meal</li>
            <li>¼ cup of heavy cream</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Remove the husks from the corn; try to keep each husk intact, the large ones will be used as wrappers for the humitas and the smaller ones will be broken into long strips to tie around the humitas.</li>
            <li>To help make the corn husks more pliable place them in a pot of boiling water for a couple of minutes, then drain the water and save the husks until ready to use.</li>
            <li>Remove the silky hairs from the corn and use a knife to cut the corn kernels from the cob, if you don’t have a steamer save the cobs to use as a steamer.</li>
            <li>Place the corn kernels, 1 cup of cheese, diced onions, crushed garlic, ground coriander, corn meal, cream, eggs, and salt in the food processor, mix until the corn is pureed.</li>
            <li>In large deep pot place about 2 ½ cups of water and a steamer, the water should be just below the steamer, if you don’t have a steamer arrange the cobs on the bottom of the pan instead and cover them with some of the leftover husks.</li>
            <li>
                <p>To fill each humita (see detailed instructions on filling above as well as pictures), use 2 of the large corn husks per humita, place them on top of each other, fold the left side of the husks, then fold the top half over the bottom half, this creates a semi-pocket, fill it with a spoonful of the mixture</p>
                <p>(how much mixture will depend on the size of the husks, the larger the husks the more filling you can add) and stuff some of theremaining cheese in the middle, now fold over the right side of the husk and tighten it up a little bit, use the thin strips to tie around the wrapper and keep it closed.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Place the humitas in the pot on top of the steamer, I like to keep them slightly inclined with the open end on top. Place any leftover husks on top and cover well.</li>
            <li>Place the pot on the stove over high heat until you hear the water boiling, reduce to a simmer and cook for about 35-40 minutes, the cooked humitas will be slightly firm to firm when they are done.</li>
            <li>Serve warm with aji de tomate de arbol or tree tomato hot sauce.</li>
        </ol>
